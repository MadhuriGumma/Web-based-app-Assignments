<h2>Process to create Github account</h2>
<h4><p>Steps to follow to create a <span style="color:blue;">git hub account are:</span></p></h4>
<p>Steps to create a github account are:
    <ol>
        <li>Go to the website www.github.com</li>
        <li>Go to create account on the page </li>
        <li>Give in your email id and name</li>
        <li>Click on Create account</li>
    </ol>

</p>
<h4><p2> Once the account is created, it appears like the below image.
</p2></h4>


<div><a href="https://github.com/MadhuriGumma/Web-based-app-Assignments/tree/master/Lab%201/documentation" target =_blank>
    <img src="repository_creation.png"/></a> </div>

<p>

        <ul>
            <li>After it is done click on repositories and there you could see a button to create a <span style="color:#4cff5c;">new repository</span></li>
            <li>Once you get a new page, you could give a name for the repository and then click create repository</li>
        </ul>
        That page would look like the page below:
</p>


<div>
    <a href="https://github.com/MadhuriGumma/Web-based-app-Assignments/tree/master/Lab%201/documentation" target =_blank>
        <img src="new_repository.png"></a></div>


<p>
    Now download the github desktop application and give in your credentials.It appears like the below image and use
        this to commint any changes made in the local machine and push it to the git.
        So whatever changes you would make in the local machine would be visible on this and you need to commit to the master to see the changes online
</p>


<a href="https://github.com/MadhuriGumma/Web-based-app-Assignments/tree/master/Lab%201/documentation" target =_blank>
    <img src="github%20image.png"/></a>



<p>
     Now you could work on any number of file and upload them onto github and make changes online.
        You could run projects online and share your work. You could allow all your work to the people to see.Its a good practice to commit once you make changes
